I have secured an application using letsencrypt and deplyed to and AWS instance using Docker-compose. This application is now secured for the domain robwebsite.tk. This domain is proxied by an Nginx webserver.

Note: The IP for the domain robwebsite.tk no longer exists, need to update the IP of the domain.

Also if nginx.conf needs needs to be stord on host in order for this to work.
